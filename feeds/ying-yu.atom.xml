&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between "may be not" and "may not be" ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example:    &lt;br /&gt;
- She may be not a student.   &lt;br /&gt;
- She may not be a student.   &lt;br /&gt;
==&amp;gt; Do the two sentences have the same meaning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[1] She may be not a student, ...    &lt;br /&gt;
Meaning =&amp;gt; True, she is not a student, she's a teacher, but she works just as hard as a student. She studies English at home on her own time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[2] She may not be a student.    &lt;br /&gt;
Meaning =&amp;gt; There is a possibility that she is not a student.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modal may, like modal must, is ambiguous between epistemic and deontic modality:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deontic modality    &lt;br /&gt;
Ex: She may go to school.    &lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; permission; e.g., she is allowed to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negated    &lt;br /&gt;
Ex: She may not go to school.    &lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; permission to go to school is denied.    &lt;br /&gt;
Epistempic modality    &lt;br /&gt;
Ex: She may be at school.    &lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; possibility;e.g., It is possible that she is at school.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negated    &lt;br /&gt;
Ex: She may not be at school.    &lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; There's a possibility that she is not at school.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex: She may be not at school, but ...       &lt;br /&gt;
=&amp;gt; True, she is not at school, she's at home, but she's at home studying right now as if she were in school.    &lt;br /&gt;
Does that help?       &lt;/p&gt;
